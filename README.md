## 📌 Project Overview

ConvoX Meet is a full-stack real-time video conferencing application that enables users to create secure meeting rooms and connect instantly using peer-to-peer WebRTC communication.

The system uses Socket.io for signaling and WebRTC for direct media streaming between participants, ensuring low latency and efficient communication.

The platform is designed with scalability, performance optimization, and clean UI/UX principles.
